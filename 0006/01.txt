On the one hand, running the red light is not a civilized behavior, Chinese 
people will bring the foreign people the bad impression. When a foreigner comes

 waits for the green light, while a lot of Chinese people ignore the traffic 
rule and go directly. He feels so hilarious about the situation, it is so 
uncivilized behavior.
