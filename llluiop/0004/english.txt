Now that the city is back in the hands of terrorists, officials are "extremely concerned about massacres that we think will be committed by ISIS," said Haimour, the Anbar governor's spokesman.

"On the first day that ISIS took over the city, they executed a 3-year-old girl whose father was fighting against ISIS. And he later died in battle," he told CNN.

ISIS has a grim track record of ruthlessly slaughtering opponents it captures.

"Anybody who supported the government will probably be executed within the next 24 hours," said Baer. "Their families will be driven out. It will be a bloodbath over the next couple of days. All the soldiers who were captured will be executed."

A flood of residents has been pouring out of Ramadi toward safer parts of Anbar and Baghdad in recent days.

"We are witnessing a humanitarian crisis," said Haimour, estimating that as many as 8,000 people had left the city Sunday.

As civilians fled, the heavy fighting continued.

Officials estimate that more than 500 people have been killed in the most recent clashes in Ramadi, he said, noting that some pockets of resistance against ISIS remained inside the city.
